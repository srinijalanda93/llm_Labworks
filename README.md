<H2>Implement a story generation Natural Language Generation using any transformer-based Foundation models.</H2>
Comparative Study on any three models:
• Understand the importance of Natural Language Generation and its role in NLP.
• Discuss the relevance of story generation as an NLG task.
• Compare and contrast different transformer-based models such as GPT-
2/3/Neo, BERT, T5, BART, and FLAN-T5, specifically in the context of

creative text generation.
Model Selection and Justification:
• Select a suitable pre-trained transformer model for your story generation task.
• Justify your choice based on model architecture, training corpus,generation capabilities, and efficiency.
• Optionally, consider using models from Hugging Face Transformers library.

<h2>LAB-3</h2>
<h3>Implement a Comparative Analysis of Foundation and Domain-Specific Models</h3>
<h3>Comparative Study on any three models: (1 foundation and 2 Domain-Specific)</h3>
• Understand the importance of Domain-Specific models in various domains (Finance, Education, Healthcare, Legal, Sports, E-commerce,News & Media and more)
• Compare and contrast different transformer-based foundation models such as GPT, BERT, T5, BART, FLAN-T5 or other with domain-specificmodels Model Selection
• Domain-Specific Model Examples:
Finance: FinBERT, BloombergGPT, Healthcare: BioGPT, ClinicalBERT
Legal: Legal-BERT, CaseLaw-BERT, Education: EduBERT, SciBERT
Sports/Media: MediaSum-based T5, E-commerce: AmazonProductBERT
